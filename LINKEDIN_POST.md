🚀 **Just shipped: Google Scholar MCP Server** - Making AI assistants smarter for academic research!

I'm excited to share my latest open-source project that bridges the gap between AI assistants and academic research.

**The Problem:**
Researchers and students spend hours manually searching Google Scholar, tracking citations, and organizing papers. What if Claude or other AI assistants could do this natively?

**The Solution:**
I built a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI assistants direct access to Google Scholar. Now Claude can:

📚 **Search Publications** - Find papers by topic, author, or date range
👤 **Discover Researchers** - Get author profiles with h-index, citations, and co-authors
🔗 **Analyze Citations** - Track who's citing what and understand research impact
📥 **Download Papers** - Store papers locally for offline access
🔍 **Advanced Search** - Filter by language, patents, review articles

**Real-world example:**
"Claude, find the top 10 most-cited papers on transformer architectures from 2020-2024, analyze who's building on this work, and create a literature review outline."

→ One prompt. Complete research workflow.

**Tech Stack:**
• TypeScript + MCP SDK
• Web scraping with rate limiting
• In-memory caching for performance
• Local storage for paper management

**11 tools, 6 research prompts, fully open-source.**

If you're building with MCP or interested in AI-powered research tools, I'd love to connect! Drop a comment with your use cases.
